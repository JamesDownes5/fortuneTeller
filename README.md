# Fortune Teller

## Introduction

If your reading this, you'll have to tell me how you got here.

This is my first coding project and the premise is to create a Fortune Teller for my EPQ, to make me look more appealling to the universities I have applied to, even though I have been told by the head of computer science at my college that astrology might not be a great hit with computer science professors. Oh well.

## What I have Achieved so Far

- Created a function that takes a birthday and returns a star sign (Harder than you think or maybe I'm just dumb)
- Compiled a massive dictionary of information about each star sign
- Created GUI for the app using Tk (Which is completely pointless now as I plan to turn it into a web app, as I'll have to use CSS, so if anyone can make me feel like I haven't wasted time learning how to write tkinter code, please inform me)

## TODO

- Add Webscraping to collect information on daily horoscopes
- Use html and css to recreate current application as web application
- Use Django/Flask to add the current app logic to web application
- Host the final product on the web
